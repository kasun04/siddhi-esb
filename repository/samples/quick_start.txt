PT - Multiple Flows
====================

define stream inFlow ( ptcontext string, receivingFlow string);
define stream outFlow ( ptcontext string, receivingFlow string);
define stream cbrFow ( ptcontext string, receivingFlow string);

from inFlow select ptcontext, receivingFlow insert into cbrFow;
from cbrFow select ptcontext, 'http://localhost:9000/service/EchoService' as endpoint, receivingFlow insert into sender;
from outFlow select ptcontext insert into responder;



CBR - Multiple Flows
=====================


define stream inFlow ( ptcontext string, receivingFlow string);
define stream outFlow ( ptcontext string, receivingFlow string);
define stream cbrFow ( ptcontext string, receivingFlow string);

from inFlow select ptcontext, receivingFlow insert into cbrFow;
from cbrFow [siddhiESB:evalXPath('/getQuote/request/symbol') == '<symbol>kasun</symbol>' ] select ptcontext, 'http://localhost:9000/service/EchoService' as endpoint, receivingFlow insert into sender;
from outFlow select ptcontext insert into responder;



Transformations - Multiple Flows
================================

define stream inFlow ( ptcontext string, receivingFlow string);
define stream outFlow ( ptcontext string, receivingFlow string);
define stream transformFlow ( ptcontext string, receivingFlow string);

from inFlow select ptcontext, receivingFlow insert into transformFlow;
from transformFlow [siddhiESB:xsltTransform('/repository/resources/samples/transform.xslt') == 'true' ] select ptcontext, 'http://localhost:9000/service/EchoService' as endpoint, receivingFlow insert into sender;
from outFlow select ptcontext insert into responder;



PT, CBR and Transform
=====================

define stream inFlow ( ptcontext string, receivingFlow string);
define stream outFlow ( ptcontext string, receivingFlow string);
define stream cbrapi ( ptcontext string, receivingFlow string);
define stream tranformapi ( ptcontext string, receivingFlow string);

from inFlow select ptcontext, 'http://localhost:9000/service/EchoService' as endpoint, receivingFlow insert into sender;
from outFlow select ptcontext insert into responder;

from cbrapi [siddhiESB:evalXPath('/message/payload/buyStocks/info/company/text()') == 'WSO2' ] select ptcontext, 'http://localhost:9000/service/EchoService' as endpoint, receivingFlow insert into sender;
from tranformapi [siddhiESB:xsltTransform('/repository/resources/samples/transform.xslt') == 'true' ] select ptcontext, 'http://localhost:9000/service/EchoService' as endpoint, receivingFlow insert into sender;
